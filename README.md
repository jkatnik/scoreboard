# Scoreboard assigment

## Key Design Principles

- KISS (Keep it simple, stupid)
- YAGNI (You aren't gonna need it)

## Assumptions
At first, I wanted to implement simple Event Sourcing solution, and publish-subscribe pattern to emmit
changes to scoreboard observers, but then I read in the assigment description that implementation should
be as simple as possible.
